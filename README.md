📧 Voice-Based Email System for Blind

The Voice-Based Email System for Blind is a Python-based application designed to help visually impaired users send and receive emails using only voice commands.
It integrates speech recognition for taking user input and text-to-speech (TTS) for reading system prompts and responses aloud, ensuring a fully accessible experience.

🎯 Project Overview

Allows blind/visually impaired users to send emails without typing.

Uses voice input to capture email addresses, passwords, subject, and message body.

Uses speech synthesis (TTS) to guide users through the process.

Provides seamless Gmail integration for sending/receiving mails.

🛠️ Technologies & Libraries

Python 3.x

speech_recognition → Converts user’s speech into text

gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) → Converts text into audio prompts

pyglet → Plays audio files generated by gTTS

smtplib & imaplib → For sending and receiving emails

email → For constructing and parsing email messages

⚙️ Workflow

Login Phase

System prompts user for sender’s email and password (via voice).

User speaks input, which is recognized and converted to text.

Compose Email

System asks for recipient’s email address.

System asks for subject and message body.

Send Email

Uses smtplib to send email securely through Gmail’s SMTP server.

Read Emails (optional extension)

Uses imaplib to fetch unread emails and reads them aloud using TTS.

🚀 Example Flow

System (TTS): “Tell the sender’s email”

User (voice): “exampleuser” → App interprets as exampleuser@gmail.com

System (TTS): “Tell the password”

User (voice): Speaks password

System (TTS): “Tell the recipient’s email”

User (voice): Speaks recipient’s address

System (TTS): “Tell the subject of your mail”

System (TTS): “Tell the message body”
